# AFK Voice Control Chrome Extension
AFK or Away From Keyboard is a chrome extension that allows users to control their web page navigation by voice. This project was one of the top 35 submissions for [nwHacks2020](https://devpost.com/software/afk-bec9g1), winning the “Wolfram Award”.

## :star: Introduction 
We wanted to create something that anyone can use AFK for chrome. Whether it be for accessibility reasons -- such as for those with disabilities that can't use the keyboard -- or for daily use when you're cooking, our aim was to make scrolling and Chrome browsing easier.

## :pushpin: Features 
* Scroll through pages by saying "go down/up"
* Open and close new tabs by saying "open/close tab"
* Navigate between tabs by saying "go back/forward"
* Refresh and reload the page by saying "reload/refresh"
* Auto scroll through a page by reading the last words shown on screen. 

## :wrench: How We Built It 
Stack overflow, lots of panicked googling, almost giving up after having to switch ideas halfway through the hackathon but ended up making it through with our new idea: AFK. :sweat_smile:

Oh, and we also used Mozilla's web speech API. :thumbsup:
